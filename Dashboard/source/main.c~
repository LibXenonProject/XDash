/* XDash is a graphical dashboard interface, based on the text-based
\ dashboard system of the previous XDash. The aim is to create an
\ "alternative dashboard" which is completely free and open source.
\ Code execution, file browsing, and developer features are the core
\ goals for this project.
\
\  XDash is still in early development but should be reletively bug free, if
\  there is a bug in the code however, feel free to notify me at:
\  tylerjkuck@gmail.com
\
\  Please enjoy XDash, and feel free to edit this source code as you see fit!
\  Just remember to give proper credit where credit is due.
