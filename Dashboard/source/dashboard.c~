/* This is the main menu source file. The main menu will be
   rendered and displayed here. In addition, input will also
   be handled here. This source file doesn't contain any
   of the functions to interact with low level components
   (such as SFCX). Instead, it will call these functions
   from different source files upon user demand.

   This way, everything will be nice and separated.
   We can have many small modules of code instead of
   throwing everything into main.c This should increase
   code efficiency, as well as editability and update 
   ability in the future.
