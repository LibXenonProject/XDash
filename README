This is the new home for XDash developments. Over the past several months, since my skill as a programmer has improved greatly, I have been able to complete a lot of the tools which I once wanted to incorporate into XDash. Currently, such tools live in my private local repository while I test and debug them, but they incldude:

NAND Reading/writing
Complete serial control
Enabling/disabling debugging (Serial, USB, or TFTP logging)
Verbose debugging support (Based on a user specified config file)
Memory dump support (Included in verbose debugging if specified)
Elf launching (Including Linux binaries)

As I test and verify these tools, they'll be incorporated one at a time into XDash. Since graphical libraries have become more readily available and easy to setup than before, XDash will also have a graphical user interface (Most likely based on libPNG). 

For right now, this repository will only hold the old XDash code. Over the coming week I will start to re-design it from nearly the ground up, ans start importing utilities from my local repository.



*******************************************************************************************************

I stopped developing XDash many months ago, due to my homebrew console crapping out on me.
This was my main project, and I really wanted to finish it. 

Due to a few people forking this
project from me on GitHub, I decided to resume work on the project, even without a homebrew
console. I will be pushing commits to this project again, with some regularity depending on
my real life work schedule.

If anybody reading this is willing to test the code on their console, please, email me
the results!
